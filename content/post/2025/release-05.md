The May release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* SBY now supports verification of designs containing blackboxes. Add `cutpoint -blackbox` at the end of your `[script]` section and all outputs of blackbox instances will be considered unconstrained.

In other YosysHQ news:

* The LatchUp open source silicon conference happened in Santa Barbara last weekend. Catch up on the many interesting talks with [the video recordings](https://fossi-foundation.org/latch-up/2025)!

Happy May,

The YosysHQ Team
