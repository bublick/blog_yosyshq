The Yosys User's Group is for anyone who uses Yosys. We present recent updates to the tools, showcase new features and invite our users to present their work.

Join the call at [https://meet.jit.si/yosys-users-group](https://meet.jit.si/yosys-users-group).

## YUG 11 - Triple modular redundancy - 18:00 CEST Thursday 9th October

In this YUG, Matt Young, an Australian Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) student, will explain how they worked towards an automated [TMR EDA flow](https://blog.yosyshq.com/p/tamara-towards-a-triple-modular-redundancy-pass-for-yosys/), with their thesis "TaMaRa: Towards an Automated TMR EDA Flow for Yosys". This seminar will cover both the design and formal verification, of the algorithm and its application to Yosys; whilst addressing notable limitations and future improvements.

## YUG 10 - ASIC synthesis with Yosys - 18:00 CET Thursday 20th February

Emil will present ASIC synthesis with Yosys, covering the following topics:

* ASIC synthesis in general
* Yosys scripts
* abc scripts
* New Yosys features for ASIC

## YUG 9 - Understanding the Yosys synth_ice40 flow

In this meetup, Krystine explores and explains the synthesis flow for ice40 FPGAs. Covering elaboration, flattening, and mapping the various blocks, this presentation will answer all your questions about the FPGA synthesis flow!

## YUG 8 - Using formal to detect information leakage

After a long summer break, our meetings have resumed again! Our last meeting on October 29th had [Katharina CeesaySeitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katharina-ceesay-seitz-ba521087) from ETH Zürich present her work on using special netlist transformations in a custom Yosys pass in combination with formal verification to detect microarchitectural information leakage via hardware timing side channels. Watch her talk on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxp-5kNMt40).

## YUG 7 - FPGA lightning talks

6 great presentations about open source FPGA projects! Watch the talks here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZiocG8DHfE&list=PL-ggbobZGIQuMGBkQgubVbJ1jffe2k18O

Thanks to the presenters: Pat Deegan, Frans Skarman, Martín Heredia, Sasko Simonovski, Christopher Lozinski and Ashe Connor.

## YUG 6 - Hardware Security

Katharina & Flavian from ETH Zurich introduced their tool for Information Flow Tracking: https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/hardware-design-security/cellift/


## YUG 5 - SystemVerilog with Pulp’s SVase

* An introduction to [Bender](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender), [Morty](https://github.com/pulp-platform/morty) and [SVase](https://github.com/pulp-platform/svase)

## YUG 4 - all the plugins!

* List of all the plugins we know of
* Gabriel Gouvine talks about how he wrote a logic locking plugin
* Martin Povišer talks about the Python plugin API

## YUG 3 - pick your primitives!

* Show in the case of multipliers how one would go about instructing Yosys to synthesize chosen primitives a specific way.

## YUG 2 - introducing EQY!

* A [demo of our new formal equivalence tool - eqy](https://github.com/YosysHQ/eqy).

## YUG 1 - a new users group!

* What people are using Yosys for,
* How things can be improved,
* Introducing our new tools,
